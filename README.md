# ThirdPersonDemo
This is an ongoing solo learning project for myself to practise 3Cs programming in native C++ for Unreal Engine. The demo is based on Unreal Engine 4's Third Person Template which I extended with various traversal and camera control features like climbing, vaulting, wallrunning, aiming, taking cover, and so on.
